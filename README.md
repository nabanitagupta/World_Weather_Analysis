# World_Weather_Analysis
There are mutiple modules in this repository. For example, the module 'API_practice' is just a practice module to get a list of nearby cities for a given list of latitude-longitude. Then choose one of the cities from the previous list to get the weather for that specific city. The module 'WeatherPy' generates a list of random latitude-longitude combination, extract nearest city name, corresponding country code, and then list out their weather information. Export the final list to a csv file (cities.csv). Some basic data analysis/visualization are at the end for parameters like temparature, humidity, cloudyness, wind speed. 
The three main modules are below:
1. The module 'Weather_Database' generates a list of 1500 random latitude-longitude combination, extract nearest city name, corresponding country code, and then list out their weather information. Export 'WeatherPy_challenge.csv' file. 
2. The module 'Vacation_Search'  reads the previously exported 'WeatherPy_challenge.csv' file and export 'WeatherPy_vacation.csv' file. Asks user the preferred weather conditions in terms of high & low temparature, rain & snow for their vacation. Filter the dataset to find the cities that fit the criteria and store hotel names along with city, country, max temp, and coordinates to file 'WeatherPy_vacation.csv'.
3. The module 'Vacation_Itinerary' reads 'WeatherPy_vacation.csv' and then plots a simple vacation itinerary.
